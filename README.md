# Generative_model_using_pytorch_Autoencoders
Generative modeling is an approach in machine learning that focuses on modeling and understanding the underlying probability distribution of the input data. It involves training a model to generate new data samples that resemble the original training data.
In generative modeling, the goal is to capture the statistical patterns and dependencies present in the data and learn a model that can generate new samples that follow those patterns. This is achieved by estimating the probability distribution of the data and sampling from that distribution to generate new instances.

In the context of autoencoders, the Decoder module can be seen as a generative model.

The purpose of the Decoder is to take an encoded representation of data (typically obtained from an Encoder module) and reconstruct the original input data. It learns to generate output data that closely resembles the input data it was trained on.

By training the autoencoder to minimize the reconstruction loss (such as mean squared error), the Decoder learns to capture important features and patterns in the input data. It can then use this learned information to generate new data samples that are similar to the training data.

In other words, the Decoder acts as a generative model because it has learned the underlying distribution of the training data and can generate new samples from that distribution. This can be useful for tasks such as data generation, data augmentation, or even generating novel data samples based on the learned patterns and features.
